# stereoDelay


This is a simple stereo delay built with the JUCE Framework and C++. It offers the option to switch between normal stereo mode and a ping-pong mode.

The plugin offers the option to adjust delay time in ms, feedback, wet/dry mix as well as syncincg the delay time to the bpm of your DAW.
When in ping-pong mode, it also offers the options to control how much signal gets sent to each channel and to invert it. 

The code was heavily inspired by Will Pirkles's book Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++.
