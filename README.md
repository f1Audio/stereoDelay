# **Stereo Delay Plugin** 🎛️🎶  
*A professional-grade stereo delay audio plugin built with C++ and the JUCE framework.*  

## **Overview**  
This **stereo delay plugin** demonstrates **advanced DSP concepts** and **modern C++ programming**. It offers **two delay modes**:  
✅ **Stereo Mode** – Applies equal delay to both left and right channels.  
✅ **Ping-Pong Mode** – Alternates delay between channels for a **wider stereo effect**.  

Inspired by Will Pirkle’s *"Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++"*, this plugin follows **industry-standard DSP design principles** for optimal performance.

## **Features** 🚀  
🔹 **Dual-Mode Operation** – Switch between **traditional stereo** and **ping-pong delay**.  
🔹 **Delay Time Control** – Adjust delay time in **milliseconds** or **sync to DAW tempo**.  
🔹 **Adjustable Feedback** – Fine-tune the decay of repeated signals.  
🔹 **Wet/Dry Mix Parameter** – Blend the delayed signal with the original.  
🔹 **Ping-Pong Mode Enhancements** – Channel-specific delay controls + signal inversion for **creative sound design**.  
🔹 **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Built with **JUCE**, supporting multiple DAWs.  
🔹 **Optimized DSP Performance** – Efficient **real-time audio processing** in C++.
